Server broadcasts a packet every second by UDP on port 49155. This is so clients can find the server.
You should probably use Java's DatagramSocket and DatagramPacket for sending and receiving.
The server triggers voting when half the duration of the final song of a playlist is done.
It then broadcasts a notification on port 49156 that the voting period has begun. It can then receive votes on the same port.
A vote is currently simply a song name, i.e. a String.

Note that the server is still fairly untested, I'll get to that on Sunday if possible, but I just wanted to give an idea of the interface.
